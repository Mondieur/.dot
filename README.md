# All-in-one Manual
My personal dotfiles.

1. Move the `.Xresources` file to `./~`
2. Move the `.emacs.d` folder to `./~`
3. Download all apps from `/pacman/` folder.

Some scripts are optional utilities.

### Distributions
- Ubuntu has annoying interrupting security features
- Mint has gui and it's more straight to programming than Ubuntu.
- Arch has not a gui, neither native apps, thus more optimized than Mint.
